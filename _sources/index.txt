MLPP
====

Machine Learning (*not only*) with Point Processes
--------------------------------------------------

`MLPP` is yet another machine learning library for ``Python``, with a
particular emphasis on point processes (Poisson processes,
Hawkes processes, Cox regression), but includes also generalized linear
models (GLM). It comes with optimization algorithms for inference and
provides tools for simulation of datasets.
A particular focus is on optimization: an extensive optimization toolbox
is proposed, with recent state-of-the-art stochastic solvers.

Main highlights
---------------

* **Python 3 only**!
* Fast, most computation are done in C++11 (including multi-threading)
* Contains an optimization toolbox: solvers (optimization algorithms),
  models (for computing gradient among other things) and
  prox (penalization) classes can be combined interactively in
  ``iPython`` for instance
* Features state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms, with
  parallel implementations
* Support sparse datasets (sparse features matrices)
* Interplay between Python and C++ is done using swig
