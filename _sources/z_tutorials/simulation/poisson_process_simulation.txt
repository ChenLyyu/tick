Poisson processes simulation
============================

This example illustrates the use of `mlpp.simulation.SimuInhomogeneousPoisson`
and `mlpp.simulation.SimuPoissonProcess` which are classes that allow us to simulate
these two kinds of processes.

Poisson process with constant intensity
----------------------------------------

.. plot:: z_tutorials/simulation/code_samples/poisson_constant_intensity.py
    :include-source:

We can notice that elapsed time between two jumps follow as expected an
exponential distribution of parameter :math:`\frac{1}{\lambda}` where
:math:`\lambda` is the constant intensity of the Poisson process.

Inhomogeneous Poisson processes
-------------------------------

Now we plot a Poisson process with varying intensity

.. plot:: z_tutorials/simulation/code_samples/poisson_simple_homogeneous.py
    :include-source:

We see that the higher the intensity is, the more ticks we have.
